# MKW Course Randomizer

This is a simple project to randomize the Mario Kart World Courses. As of now, Nintendo has implemented no option to play just the lap courses, not the intermission ones, at random. You can select them on the map, but still, not random.
You can acces the site via [this link]("https://maeschdev.github.io/MKW-Course-Randomizer/").

Click on "Randomize" to get a random course. You still have to find the course on the map tho...
